# Predictive_Analysis_on_Wholesale_Distribution_Optimization_Task

## Overview
Company XYZ is a wholesale distributor that serves a number of business clients (e.g., retailers, restaurants, hotels, or cafes).   
We would like to get a deeper understanding of the spending patterns of clients to make strategic decisions to better meet the clients’ demand (e.g., to improve inventory management and avoid shortages).  

More speficially, we are interested in applying clustering analysis to understand client annual spending patterns (in a standardized monetary unit). Are there any meaningful client groups / types? If so, how are they distributed across different channels or regions?  

## Dataset
A dataset of 440 clients is provided. Each record corresponds to a client, and contains a client’s region, channel, and the client’s annual spending across 6 product categories.  

(Variable Name / Description)  
• Channel / Client channel (“1” means Horeca (Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe) and “2” means Retail)

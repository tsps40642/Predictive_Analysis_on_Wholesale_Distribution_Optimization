# Predictive_Analysis_on_Wholesale_Distribution_Optimization

## Overview
Company XYZ is a wholesale distributor that serves a number of business clients (e.g., retailers, restaurants, hotels, or cafes).   
We would like to get a deeper understanding of the spending patterns of clients to make strategic decisions to better meet the clients’ demand (e.g., to improve inventory management and avoid shortages). More speficially, we are interested in analyzing annual spending of XYZ's business clients (in a standardized monetary unit). 

## Dataset
A dataset of 440 clients is provided.  
Each record corresponds to a client, and contains a client’s region, channel, and the client’s annual spending across 6 product categories.  

Variable Name/Description
Channel Client channel (“1” means Horeca (Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe) and
“2” means Retail).
Region Client region (“1” means Lisbon, “2” means Oporto, and “3” means
other regions)
Fresh Annual spending on fresh products.
Milk Annual spending on milk products.
Grocery Annual spending on grocery products.
Frozen Annual spending on frozen products.
Detergents Paper Annual spending on detergents and paper products.
Delicatessen Annual spending on deli products

## Steps
Apply the appropriate data analytics technique(s) to understand client spending pat-
terns. Specifically, are there any meaningful client groups / types? If so, how are they
distributed across different channels or regions?
1.2 Based on your exploratory findings, provide some recommendations to XYZ’s manage-
ment that may help them in decision-making.
You will find that the tasks are (intentionally) framed to be quite general and vague —
this is very often the case in real-world exploratory analytics problems. Therefore, applying
certain analytics technique/algorithm is only one part of the solution. You are also respon-
sible for stating / defining the managerial problem, interpreting your analyses and results,
and offering relevant insights
